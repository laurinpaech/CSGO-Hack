# CSGO External Hack for macOS - Triggerbot + Wallhack

Things I still want to add:

- Multithreading for dual use of Wallhack + Triggerbot while shooting
- Different shooting modes for the Triggerbot
- Aimbot

### Hello Friend!
If you have never used Xcode, go and watch @gabsens’s [Video at Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AefIiBg2HKU)

### How to run?
Clone it from Github and run it as root

### What if CS:GO updates?
Nothing. Since there is pattern scanning implemented you don't need to update any Offset-Pointers.

### Is it safe?
Should be safe against VAC.
Depending on how you play and use it also for Overwatch.
